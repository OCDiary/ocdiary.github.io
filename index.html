<p>I made this mod to work in a modpack I was developing. The idea came around because I needed to stop players being out in just any dimension. I wanted to restrict them to being stuck in a dimension of my choosing until a time they were op enough to venture to the others. Hence this mod. Does it have a large use in the community, you tell me? Im not sure but I thought seeing as it was made and done I might as well put it out there for people to try. I am thinking of implementing new dimensions with effects, and maybe also making it more customizable (however it already is pretty customizable now!).</p>

<p>Are you a modpack maker? Do you also stream on a streaming platform? Do you wish more people could find your channel easily if they enjoy your modpack?</p>
<p>If you answered yes to the above questions do not worry... WE HAVE THE ANSWER!!!</p>
<p>This mod renders an icon onto the screen which will highlight red when you go live! When users click the icon, they will get a drop down of streamers who are live, when they hover over them they will get information about their streams, such as title, viewer count, game, oh and if they press the Shift a stream preview will pop up! What could be better than that you ask??? Well with a simple click on the icon their native browser will open and take them directly to your livestream! So they can get to your broadcast in seconds!!!</p>
<p>The mod has a full GUI config where many of the features can be configured to your liking. To get to the GUI simply ALT-Left Click to get to the menu, then edit the various options!</p>
